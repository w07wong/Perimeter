Planning a trip to the city with friends is often a more challenging task than it seems at first. The burdens of over scheduling and planning out logistics pose challenges to individuals in such situations. Since we often go to places we are unfamiliar with, having a local of city life and culture will seriously enhance our experience.

We often take an Uber into San Francisco with the expectation that we know where we're going. Our conversations with our Uber drivers have taught us how much we truly know and understand about the cities. But often times, through these conversations, we find ourselves discovering places that we realize are much more enjoyable than our original destinations.

Foreign travelers face a far worse problem - they pay hundreds of dollars to take buses through a city and miss out meeting locals, experiencing the culture of the city, and learning what makes the city they're visiting unique. Travelers miss out the lesser known, but equally as important experiences within every city.

Perimeter solves both of these problems. People who live in a city, following a thorough application review, can become a guide and consolidate the best part of their lives into a single day for travelers to appreciate. Cities mean much more than just monuments, and they are living cultures that everyone should be able to experience.
